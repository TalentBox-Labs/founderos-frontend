# WorkCrew CRM — Frontend

React (Vite) frontend for the WorkCrew CRM platform. Connects to the FastAPI
backend (`runner_api.py`) running on port 8000.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (`node --version`)
- The backend running: `python3 -m uvicorn runner_api:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000`
  (from the repo root)

## Run it

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 — you'll see the CRM with:

- **Dashboard** — overview stats + live backend/analytics status
- **Contacts** — contact list with an add-contact form
- **Deals** — pipeline view with stages and win rate
- **Analytics** — dashboard templates loaded live from the API

API calls are proxied through Vite (`/api` → `http://localhost:8000`), so no
CORS configuration is needed in development.

## Configuration

Optional environment variables (create `frontend/.env.local`):

```
VITE_API_BASE=/api          # or a full URL for a hosted backend
VITE_API_KEY=demo-key       # bearer token sent to the API
```

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build     # outputs static files to frontend/dist
npm run preview   # serve the production build locally
```
